When we talk about personal colors, you've probably come across those figures with color wheels, neatly organized into specific palettes or schemes using the concept of the four seasons. 

These figures can be typed into 4, 12, 16, or even 24 seasonal subtypes! 

However, the most common and widely used system is the 12 subtypes. 

Personal color exploration allows us to pinpoint our specific location on the color wheel map. 

But, the color wheel isn't a static entity;it's a dynamic continuum of relativity that
spans across every subtype and through out every season, forming a vibrant spectrum. 

It's important to understand that the subtype we identify ourselves with, is just one piece of the puzzle. The adjacent subtype becomes our complementary or secondary seasonal subtype. 

This highlights that every subtype on this wheel isn't a standalone entity, but is intricately linked to its neighboring subtypes, forming a continuous flow. 

So, as we navigate the colorful landscape of personal color, keep in mind that your color identity is part of a larger interconnected system. 

It's not about fitting into a rigid box but understanding the dynamic relationship between your primary and secondary subtypes. 

Our position in the wheel depends on 3 dimensions: the hue, value and chroma. 

First up, let's talk about hue. 

It's basically how we all see and name colors, just like the classic rainbow lined up with red, orange, green, blue, and the rest of the colors. 

Now here's a fun fact, all colors, or hues,are born from the OG three primary colors  red, yellow, and blue. 

Every other color you see is just a mix of these primaries. 

When we mix them in different ratios, we get a whole range of hues, and each hue carries its unique temperature. 

For example, adding a touch of yellow to red can warm it up, giving us a warm orange glow. 

On the flip side, introducing blue to red can cool it down, resulting in a cool toned violet. 

These primary colors are like our temperature wizards, letting us dial up the warmth or coolness in our color palette. 

So the hue tells us the color temperature of the color, as in how warm or cool it is.
The more yellow is added to a color, the warmer it becomes.The more blue is added to it, the cooler it becomes. 

The second dimension of color, known as value,defines the lightness or darkness of a hue. 

Colors follow a natural order, offering aspectrum of choices within each color family ranging from light to dark shades. 

By mixing black or white to a color, you areable to alter the color’s value. 

In simple terms, when a color appears lighter,it signifies that it is closer to the color 'white’, resulting in a higher value.
Conversely, if a color appears darker, it indicates that it is closer toward the color
'black,' yielding a lower value. 

Take, for instance, a pure red color.
By introducing white, you increase its value,transitioning from red to lighter shades like pink and eventually to white.
Conversely, adding black to red reduces its value, transforming it into deeper hues like burgundy and ultimately into black. 

Therefore, in the context of personal color analysis, individuals who are better suited
for lighter colors are categorized as the light subtypes.On the other hand, those whose appearance is enhanced by darker colors fall into the deep subtypes. 

Understanding the concept of value also plays a significant role in determining the contrast between different tones. 

Contrast refers to the comparison between the values of two colors for example, the
difference in lightness or darkness of the colors.The greater the difference between the values of two colors, the higher the level of contrast or vice versa. 

When we position two tones that are extremely light and dark side by side, it creates a high-contrast effect.On the other hand, if two colors with similar values are placed together, it results in a low-contrast combination. 

Generally, combinations with high contrast tend to be more eye-catching and clear, capturing attention with their bold distinctions.Conversely, low-contrast combinations appear softer and more subtle, offering a gentler aesthetic appeal. 

The third dimension of color is chroma, representing the dimension that determines brightness or dullness. 

Chroma essentially describes how vibrant a color is and is measured by its distance from gray on the color spectrum.
Colors positioned on the color wheel have high chroma, showcasing their maximum brightness and vibrancy. 

As colors move toward the lower end of brightness,approaching gray, they are referred to as dulled, dustier, muted, or low chroma. 

To adjust chroma, additional colors are introduced to the pure hue.Introducing gray to a color diminishes its chroma. 

The measurement of chroma is effectively gauged by the amount of gray incorporated into the hue, shaping the overall vibrancy and intensity of the color. 

It's crucial to note that chroma and value are distinct dimensions. 

Taking a cue from the figure above, starting from the pure red hue, the value of the color increases as it moves up and decreases as it moves down. 

Simultaneously, the chroma decreases as we move toward the right, where we observe that the ratio of grayness increases across the range of colors. 

The upper most right corner colors exhibit high value and low chroma, while those at
the lowest right corner feature low value and low chroma. 

In the realm of personal color theory, individuals who appear stunning in vivid and bright colors are classified as the true or clear subtypes.On the flip side, those who are better suited to muted and softer shades fall into the soft subtypes. 

In summary, the hue of our overall tones determines whether we lean toward being warm or cool toned.
The value helps us to navigate whether we belong to the light or deep subtype, 
While the chroma defines whether we fall into the 'clear' or 'soft' subtypes. 

Together, these three dimensions create acomprehensive guide for understanding our unique color profile and choosing the most flattering colors for our individual style.
Now that we've got a good handle on the factors influencing our seasonal subtypes, let's dive into the exciting world of identifying ourcolor characteristics. 

The dimension of hue is shaped by various factors, including skin tone, hair color,
iris color, lips color, and even your preferred clothing or makeup colors.
By examining these aspects, you can identify whether you lean towards warm tones or cool tones, aiding in the determination of your season. 

In this section, let's observe ourselves and jot down our color characteristics. 

Make sure you screenshot this slide and have a mirror, paper, and pen ready to get started!
As we've mentioned earlier, our colors area mix of the primary colors: red, blue, and yellow.This principle also holds true for our skin color.Regardless of race, a yellowish-orange undertone forms the foundational tone of human skin color.
If we introduce more white to this tone, it lightens the skin, resembling the fair skin
tones found in European populations. 

Conversely, adding darker colors results in a tanner skin tone.However, the distinctive variations in under tones emerge by adjusting the ratios of blue, red and yellow colors.These adjustments play a crucial role in determining whether a skin tone leans towards warmth or coolness. 

If your skin exhibits a golden glow, it signifies a higher yellow ratio compared to other colors.
A peachy, apricot, or cinnamon appearance suggests that the red ratio in your skin undertone nearly equivalent to the yellow. 

When yellow is the dominant ratio in your skin undertone, it classifies as warm-toned. 

On the other hand, when the red ratio surpasses the yellow, the skin tends to appear more pinkish, with rosy cheeks and a light blush across the chest and ears. 

If your skin radiates a cool plum undertone,it means that the red and blue undertones in your skin are almost equal, categorizing your skin as cool-toned. 

For some individuals noticing a green under tone in their skin, giving off a bronze or green tinge in daylight, it indicates a balance between blue and yellow undertones. 

To determine if the green undertone leans towards warm or cool, it depends on the ratio of blue to yellow. 

A higher blue undertone indicates a cool tone,while a higher portion of yellow undertone makes it a warm tone.
Keep in mind that the warm or cool tone of your skin is distinct from the lightness or tanness of your skin. 

Each undertone can have a range of values,spanning from fair to dark.
The undertone determines the overall hue,while the value reflects the lightness or
darkness within that specific undertone. 

Identifying your own skin tone may seem challenging,but a simple way to gauge it is by observing your skin in pictures with your friends!
Compare your skin tone to theirs, and you can easily get a sense of your skin undertone! 

We understand that many of you find it challenging to determine your skin tone, and you might have heard about popular tests like the vein test or jewelry test.
However, it's important to note that professionals trained in color analysis often don't rely on these tests as they can be inaccurate. 

Instead, we encourage you to practice developing your eye for identifying changes in color tones in everyone's skin.
The more you compare your skin to others,the more confident you'll become in determining your own skin tone. 

Beyond skin color, our hair color also plays a significant role in determining our overall tone. 

In comparison to Europeans, Asians typically have darker hair colors, ranging from black to brunettes, dark brown, or brown tones.This distinction is essential because seasonal color palettes originating from Western countries might not be as suitable for Asians. 

When Asians identify whether their hair is cool or warm-toned, it's not solely based
on the actual hair color, but also involves considering which hair colors suit them best. 

For instance, if your actual hair color is graphite black, black-gray, cool brown, or
ash brown, and you find that you look good with hair colors having silver, grey, blue,
green, or purple undertones, you likely have cool-toned hair. 

On the other hand, if your hair appears brownish black, warm brown, or light brown, and you discover that you look great with hair colors featuring gold, orange, yellow, bronze, and brown undertones, then you likely have warm-toned hair. 

Additionally, the color of our eyes serves as a valuable reference point to determine
whether we are warm or cool-toned individuals. 

However, the color of our iris can be easily influenced by lighting conditions, thus posing a challenge in accurately observing its true color.
So, similar to hair color, we can also identif your color temperature based on the colored lenses that complement our eyes.
Before you begin, always remember to remove your makeup before making these observations, as makeup can impact your appearance. 

If your eyes have black, dark grey, or greyish undertones, and you find that colored lenses with grey, blue, pink, purple, or pure black undertones suit you better, this may indicate that you are more of a cool-toned person. 

On the other hand, if your eyes have deeper or lighter browns, or amber tones, and colored lenses with brown, orangy, golden, or olive green tones complement your eyes well, then you might be a warm-toned person. 

Now, let's talk about lip colors!
Another key factor in figuring out our color characteristics.
Make sure your lips are in good shape, andtry to avoid extreme weather conditions as they can affect the accuracy of your observations.
If your natural lip color leans towards pinkisho r purplish hues, you might be more on the cool-toned side. 

On the other hand, if you've got lips with peachy, coral, or warm red shades, that's
a clue you're leaning towards warm-toned territory. 

Moving beyond our skin, hair, lips, and eyes,our outfit colors can also provide hints about our tones. 

Take a moment to recall if there's a particular outfit color that truly enhances your complexion. Do you find yourself gravitating towards neutral tones like black, white, or gray?
Perhaps you've noticed that outfits with a pop of blue, pink, or purple really complement you. 

Or do your neutrals lean more towards ivory,beige, browns, or earthy tones?
Or maybe you feel your best with yellows and oranges. 

Take note of these preferences as they can offer valuable clues about your color characteristics. 

Applying the same concept to makeup, the looks that complement your complexion can provide insights into your color characteristics.
If you find that you look better in makeup with grey, blue, purple, or pink tones, there's
a higher chance you might be a cool-toned person.
On the other hand, if earth tones, gold, yellow,browns, and coral, or warm looks bring out your beauty, then you are likely to be a warm-toned beauty. 

Now, remember to jot down your answers for each of the aspects we mentioned earlier in the dimension of 'hues.'
This can generally guide you to determine if you lean towards being a warm or cool-toned person based on the majority of your answers. 

Moving on to the second dimension, value! 

Value defines the lightnessand darkness of hues. 

However, it's essential to note that the lightness or deepness of our skin tone doesn't necessarily represent the overall level of our value. 

The overall value of our tones is determined by factors like hair color, outfit choices and makeup colors. 

While there is a spectrum ranging from light to tanned skin tones among Asians, it's notable that when compared to Westerners, the spectrum is relatively smaller due to the presence of deeper skin tones among them. 

Generally, a majority of Asians fall within the medium to high value range for their skin tone.Additionally, Asians are commonly brunettes. 

Following the conventional personal color theory, most Asians might be typed as the
autumn or winter subtypes. 

However, this approach is evidently inaccurate. 

Hence, just because someone has a brighter or lighter skin tone? it doesn't mean their overall value will be higher.
Conversely, having a tanner or deeper skintone doesn't automatically position someone's overall value on the lower side. 

But for now, please jot down the value fory our skin tone!
Similar to what we discussed earlier, let's not only observe if the color of our hair
belongs to the lower or higher value, but also refer to the hair colors that suit us
better. 

This observation extends beyond our hair,as we will also need to include our brows.
Given that Asians typically have dark hair,we can tell the difference in the level of
value within various examples here.
If your hair appears lighter or translucent when light passes through it, and your brows are fine and sparse, you might belong to the higher value. 

On the other hand, if your hair appears darker and opaque, and you have dark bushy brows? These suggest a lower value. 

Recall the hair dye colors that fit your over all tone.Looking at this hair color palette, do you find yourself looking better with high-value colors such as golden, strawberry, grey, or silver blondes?Or do you feel that medium or low-value haircolors enhance your complexion better? 

Make a note of your observations to pinpoint where you stand. 

When it comes to outfit colors, we can assess the compatibility of our overall tones with lighter and darker outfits to determine our level of value. 

In the figure shown here, we've categorized a set of neutral colors into cool and warm tones based on their level of value. If your overall tone leans towards high value or lighter tones, you'll likely look better in outfits of pure white, white with a bluish undertone, ivory white, flaxen, and other lighter colors. 

However, incorporating a large surface area of deep colors in your outfit may make it seem like the deep tones are dominating your presence. 

If these cases are true for you, then you might have a high value or a light toned person. 

On the other hand, individuals with lower value overall tones will shine in navy blue,
pure black, deep brown.
In contrast, wearing lighter-colored outfits may affect their complexion, with the exaggerated reflection of light tones making them appear tired instead. 

If you find that the two scenarios mentioned earlier don't really apply to you, then you might be standing in the middle of the value scale.
These people usually find themselves looking better with grey, blueish grey, or camel colors! 

So in terms of outfit colors, are you a high,low or middle value person? 

Lastly, the value of one's color tone also influences the selection of makeup colors. 

High-value makeup looks feature a refreshing,natural, and airy appearance. 

They typically use lighter tones in the makeup palettes, incorporating skin-like base makeup and simple, light colors to enhance the natural complexion.
If you find yourself gravitating towards these looks, you likely suit lip shades such as purplish pink, pink, coral, light berry, peach,and nude shades. 

On the flip side, the low-value makeup look highlights the contrast between our facial
features, enhancing their presence with deeper shades.
These looks generally complement darker colors,and use makeup products that provide a solid color rather than a sheer or sheen finish.
Individuals who prefer lower-value makeup styles are generally suitable for maroon,wine red, cherry red, warm red, and brown shades. 

Of course, there's always a midpoint between both makeup looks.If your best looks consist of elements from both the high-value and low-value makeup styles,
there might be a chance that your appearance is closer to a medium value.
As we've explored the level of values of our color tones based on four factors, skin tone, hair color, outfit, and makeup colors, you can roughly gauge where you stand on the scale. 

Finally, we've come to the last dimension of colors, the Chroma. 

Chroma describes how bright, clear or muted,soft a color is. 

Chroma can be determined by multiple factors such as skin tone, brows to eyes contrast,outfit colors, makeup colors, accessories,fabric patterns, and materials. 

Individuals with high chroma have a bright appearance.
Their skin shows even and clear tones without grey or brownish pigmentation, and it has a dewy and bright texture. 

On the other hand, individuals with low chroma have a muted appearance. Their skin has a desaturated, greyish, orashy undertone and possesses a matte finish to the skin texture. 

The features of high chromas are vibrant and full of color.
You can observe that their brows are darker and fluffier, creating a higher sense of presence. The iris has a clear edge with rich, deep colors, providing a more alert and eye-catching expression. 

In contrast, low chroma individuals have lighter,finer, or more sparse brows, resulting in lower presence.The color of their iris is softer and blurry,and lacking a clear crisp edge.Their expression often gives a softer gaze,providing a delicate charm. 

So, take a good look at your skin and every feature on your face! 

Are they high or low chroma?
Additionally, the color of our outfit can give hints about whether we are high or low
chroma. 

If you prefer vibrant, higher saturation,solid color blocks like these color palettes or you love to playfully combine colors to create a beautiful contrast, these are signs
that suggest you are a high chroma person. 

On the other hand, if your taste is more towards relaxed, comfy, and subtle color options like the muted, lower saturation color palettes,and your outfit is often made up of low-contrast colors or colors that have similar tones,these can indicate that you lean towards low chroma. 

Similarly, if your makeup looks gravitate towards captivating, bold looks that capture the essence of bright, energetic vibes, incorporating a daring fusion of colorful shades such as hot pink, rosy red, warm red, and rich red that enhances your complexion and demands attention, these looks are typically high chroma looks. 

If your go-to looks emphasize a natural, effortless,and subtle appearance, using nude shades or low-saturation tones like greyish pink, dried rose, nude shades, or red bean paste shades these are characteristics of low chroma looks.

It's interesting to note that the finish or texture of your makeup products can also affect the chroma. 

High chroma or high-contrast makeup looks are often associated with glossy or highly reflective finished makeup products.
The base has a dewy touch, giving a glowy appearance as if a light layer of base was
applied to the skin.Additionally, eyeshadows with pearl escentshine or glimmers of glitters, along with lip products like lip gloss, are frequently used in these looks. 

These elements reflect light from your face,creating an airy and vibrant appearance that enhances the over all chroma of the look. 

In contrast, low chroma makeup products generally with matte finishes or soft blurring effects aim for a more natural appearance.The base creates a skin-like or porcelainskin look, achieving a no-makeup makeup appearance. It incorporates low saturation eyeshadow shades with matte textures and uses lip products with a creamy texture to achieve matte finishes. 

So, when it comes to makeup, can you identify yourself as leaning towards the high or low chroma side? 

As we mentioned earlier, high chroma tends to catch people's attention, and this also holds true for accessories, fabric patterns,and materials. 

Interestingly, this aspect is often not emphasized in most Western resources but is considered in Asian color theory systems. 

Accessories that make a statement, such asshiny, chunky pieces or larger dangling earrings that draw attention with every movement, fall into the high chroma category. 

On the other hand, smaller, dainty, and delicate pieces that subtly blend into your look belong to the low chroma category.

The same principle applies to fabric prints.
Prints with a higher visual presence, larger in size, vibrant in color, or with strong
color contrast create a high chroma combination.
These designs are often seen in animal prints,geometric patterns, or bold floral prints. 

In contrast, prints with low visual presence use similar colors, resulting in low color contrast.
Examples include small floral prints or ginghampatterns with harmonious color matching. 

Not only that, fabrics that reflect lightare also considered high chroma materials,
such as silk, velvet, leather, and PVC.
If your wardrobe is filled with these materials,it might indicate a preference for a high chroma look. 

Conversely, fabrics with a matte appearance,like cotton, denim, and linen, are categorized as low chroma materials. 

While these factors are discussed less frequently in Western resources due to their lesser significance in determining seasonal color, we believe they should be considered.
This is because outfit and accessory choices heavily depend on our personal preference and this makes them important in identifying our seasonal color based on what suits us best.
With all these factors considered in the third dimension of Chroma, we believe you can now get a grasp of where you stand in this aspect. 

After summarizing all aspects under each dimension,you can already determine your position in each of the dimensions, such as hues, chroma,and value. 

To determine your seasonal subtype, you are going to rearrange the sequence of these dimensions according to the scales that you have marked earlier. 

Therefore, by considering the significance of each dimension, we will categorize them
into primary, secondary, and tertiary features based on their impact on your seasonal subtype. 

If your results for a particular dimension lie at the extremes, these are the dimensions that should be given the most attention, as they have the most significant impact on your final placement in your seasonal color.They are usually the primary or secondary feature. 

However, whichever dimensions have results positioned in the middle of the scale have less effect on the outcome, thus marking themas the tertiary feature instead. 

In the primary feature, this is the key attribute influencing your color characteristics, with the strongest effect on your appearance.
It serves as the core principle defining your color characteristics, and deviating from the suggested color palette for this primary feature may not be advisable.
It is a foundational element that sets thetone for your overall color profile. 

Moving on to the secondary feature, this becomes the second attribute contributing to your color personality.
As the secondary feature carries less weight than the primary one, we should always fulfill the primary feature before fulfilling the secondary feature while selecting outfit or makeup. 

Given that the secondary feature carries less weight than the primary one, it's advisable to always prioritize the fulfillment of the primary feature when selecting outfits or makeup. 

However, putting too much emphasis to match the characteristics of the secondary feature might be too “excessive”.
This could potentially introduce a sense ofdiscordance to the overall appearance instead.
00:32:07.799 Finally, in the tertiary feature, this hasthe least impact on your color characteristics.
00:32:14.140 It doesn't play a significant role in determiningyour seasonal color subtype, and therefore,
00:32:19.570 it doesn't require as much attention.
00:32:22.159 On this slide, we've organized the three featuresalong with the three dimensions in a table
00:32:26.919 format.
00:32:28.090 Once you've determined the level of significancefor each dimension, you can take a screenshot
00:32:32.690 of this and mark which dimension correspondsto your primary, secondary, and tertiary features.
00:32:39.130 This will serve as a handy reference for understandingthe hierarchy of these features in your overall
00:32:44.660 color profile.
00:32:46.450 Therefore, by combining your primary and secondaryfeatures, you can determine your seasonal
00:32:52.570 color subtype.
00:32:54.100 Next please refer to this table, which summarizesthe primary and secondary features corresponding
00:32:59.840 to their respective seasonal subtypes.
00:33:02.730 This will assist you in identifying and understandingyour unique seasonal color characteristics.
00:33:10.090 Now, let's revisit this summarized table.
00:33:16.320 As mentioned earlier, the primary featureholds the highest significance, and wearing
00:33:20.559 colors directly opposite to its suggestionwill affect your appearance the most.
00:33:25.450 However, due to the consideration for theprimary feature, going for colors that slightly
00:33:30.570 deviate from the secondary feature is permissiblebecause we want to create the best color range
00:33:35.919 that suits your subtype.
00:33:37.740 Hence, the opposing color palettes of thesecondary feature may still serve as suitable
00:33:42.179 color choices.
00:33:43.899 This concept might be hard to grasp at first,but feel free to pause the video and rewatch
00:33:48.320 a few times to help you understand better!
00:33:51.260 Let’s look at some examples:
00:33:54.299 Clear spring individuals have high chromaas their primary feature and warm hues as
00:33:58.420 their secondary feature.
00:34:00.200 This means they are compatible with high chroma,vibrant cool-toned colors but not with lower
00:34:06.380 chroma, dull-looking warm-toned colors.
00:34:11.340 On the flip side, true spring individualshave warm hues as their primary feature and
00:34:15.790 high chroma as their secondary feature.
00:34:18.770 This shows that lower chroma or duller warmcolors are compatible with them but not the
00:34:23.690 higher chroma, vibrant cool-toned colors.
00:34:28.139 So if you're still unsure about your primaryfeature, you can observe yourself through
00:34:32.609 these six possibilities based on the threedimensions of hues, values, and chroma.
00:34:39.760 If hues are your primary feature that determinesyour seasonal subtype, it means that color
00:34:44.480 temperature significantly influences yourcolor appearance.
00:34:48.550 For a cool-toned person, cool-toned colorswork best, while warm-toned colors have lower
00:34:55.050 compatibility.
00:34:56.280 Take Lucy Liu as an example; cool-toned colorscreate a more refreshing, airy, and natural
00:35:03.060 look for her, while warm-toned colors maymake her appear sallow and fatigued.
00:35:09.180 Conversely, a warm-toned person thrives withwarm colors that complement their skin tone
00:35:15.300 and overall color profile.
00:35:17.810 They may not look as vibrant or energeticin cool-toned colors, which might wash them
00:35:22.690 out instead.
00:35:25.520 For individuals with value as their primaryfeature, the lightness and darkness of tones
00:35:30.200 have the most significant impact on theirappearance.
00:35:32.670 Son Ye Jin, for example, is a typical "light"person, looking best with lighter and subtle
00:35:38.579 makeup colors.
00:35:40.420 These light colors in makeup and outfits bringout her effortless, airy charisma, while deep
00:35:45.710 colors may seem too heavy, appearing as ifthe dark tones have taken over her presence.
00:35:52.720 On the other hand, individuals with low valueas their primary feature thrive with darker
00:35:57.810 tones in their overall style.
00:36:00.030 They benefit from increasing the contrastbetween the tones to create a cohesive look.
00:36:05.650 Deeper colors enhance the visual impact oftheir facial features, whereas lighter colors
00:36:10.470 might make them appear pale and lose theirindividuality.
00:36:15.340 If chroma is your primary feature, then thevibrancy of colors used has the most significant
00:36:20.349 impact on your appearance.
00:36:21.839 Nayeon, belonging to the clear spring category,looks stunning in vibrant and eye-catching
00:36:27.860 colors, lighter tones, and color combinationswith higher contrast.
00:36:32.630 These colors bring her charm to life, makingher look lively and adorable.
00:36:37.300 On the other hand, low chroma, duller-lookingcolors may blur out her facial features and
00:36:42.960 diminish her charm.
00:36:44.820 "Soft" typed individuals suit low-contrastcolor combinations and dull, soft, blurring
00:36:51.400 colors.
00:36:52.470 Low chroma colors complement the eleganceand gracefulness of Jun Ji-hyun.
00:36:56.839 However, a high chroma, vibrant-toned lookmay seem like she is trying to fit the makeup,
00:37:03.230 rather than the other way around.
00:37:05.800 By observing how changes in hues, values,and chroma affect your appearance, you can
00:37:10.911 identify which dimension has the strongestimpact on your overall look.
00:37:15.930 This understanding provides valuable insightsinto determining your possible seasonal subtype
00:37:20.980 on the color chart.
00:37:26.480 In our quest to grasp the ins and outs ofthe seasonal color system, we've delved into
00:37:31.089 various sources that break down this concept.
00:37:34.510 And guess what?
00:37:35.760 We stumbled upon a gem that offers a clearand newbie-friendly explanation.
00:37:41.040 Introducing Uireh, a renowned Korean SeasonalColor Expert, whose insights have proven invaluable.
00:37:47.670 What caught our attention is how Uireh usesdifferent natural lights to paint a vivid
00:37:52.349 picture of the four seasons in the seasonalcolor system.
00:37:55.910 It's a perspective we find quite enlightening,as it demystifies the complexity of this concept.
00:38:02.190 In her analogy, Uireh associates the Springtype with the Sun, the Summer with the Moon,
00:38:07.670 the Autumn with the Earth, and the Winteras the Star.
00:38:11.510 Recognizing that not all regions experiencefour distinct seasons, she believes the light
00:38:16.460 analogy makes it more intuitive and accessible,especially for newcomers to the world of seasonal
00:38:22.180 colors.
00:38:23.220 Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty.
00:38:26.440 We'll explore how the unique characteristicsof natural lights from the Sun, Moon, Earth,
00:38:32.690 and Star correspond to the four seasons, andwe'll look into the extensions stemming from
00:38:37.440 these four seasons.
00:38:39.339 Let's break down how the distinct qualitiesof natural lights from the Sun, Moon, Earth,
00:38:45.270 and Star align with the four seasons, accordingto Uireh's perspective.
00:38:50.150 In the realm of personal color, three mainattributes, hue, value, and chroma, play a
00:38:56.150 crucial role in differentiating colors.
00:38:58.970 Essentially, they are the key characteristicsbehind the four primary seasonal color categories.
00:39:05.079 Now, let's focus on hue.
00:39:07.770 Take a look at these pictures and tell me,which light do you perceive as warmer?
00:39:12.900 Warm light, in this context, refers to a yellowishtint.
00:39:17.200 You got it!
00:39:18.850 Sunlight and the light reflected on the earthfall into the warm light category.
00:39:23.490 That means Spring and Autumn types are associatedwith warm light.
00:39:27.550 On the flip side, which light seems cooler?
00:39:30.840 Bingo!
00:39:32.130 Moonlight and starlight bring in the cooltones, connecting them with Summer and Winter
00:39:35.890 types.
00:39:37.520 Consider it this way: daytime lights tendto be warm tones, courtesy of the sun's glow
00:39:42.530 and its reflection on the earth.
00:39:45.130 As night falls, the moon and stars take centerstage, bringing in the cool tones.
00:39:51.130 It's like a natural shift from warm to coolas the sun rises and sets.
00:39:55.720 Moving on to the second attribute of color,known as chroma.
00:39:59.930 As mentioned earlier, chroma describes thevibrancy of a color, indicating its brightness
00:40:04.839 or dullness.
00:40:06.190 The brighter and clearer a color appears,the closer it is to its pure form.
00:40:11.360 Now, let's take a closer look at these picturesand engage in a bit of chroma analysis.
00:40:16.360 Check out the warm light category, the sunlightand the light reflected on the earth.
00:40:22.390 Spot the one with high chroma, the clear andvibrant player.
00:40:26.220 Yep, you nailed it – the strong sunlightexhibits a higher chroma.
00:40:30.740 Now, onto the cool light category.
00:40:34.100 Picture moonlight and starlight.
00:40:36.400 Which one shines more powerfully, moonlightor starlight?
00:40:39.800 Bingo!
00:40:40.800 It's starlight.
00:40:42.440 Moonlight, on the other hand, brings a softand delicate spread.
00:40:47.330 As we navigate through the four seasons, itbecomes clear that sunlight and starlight
00:40:51.270 stand out with their clarity and high chroma.
00:40:54.500 On the other hand, the earth’s reflectedlight and moonlight are more subdued, with
00:40:59.001 a gentle dilution and lower saturation.
00:41:02.520 Picture it like this: sunlight and starlightare the laser beams that focus sharply on
00:41:07.310 one spot, while light bouncing off the earthand moonlight takes a more subtle approach,
00:41:13.339 spreading their glow far and wide.
00:41:15.349 Why the difference?
00:41:17.030 Well, direct light, like sunlight and starlight,is like a powerhouse, emitting light on its
00:41:23.079 own.
00:41:24.329 They are like the laser beams that focus sharplyon one spot.
00:41:27.940 On the other hand, reflected light, from theearth and moon, plays it cool, catching the
00:41:33.410 light and bouncing it around.
00:41:35.220 They take a more subtle approach, spreadingtheir glow far and wide.
00:41:40.410 Each light brings its own A-game, just likeeach season having its own strengths!
00:41:49.130 Coming to the third color attribute, value.
00:41:52.260 A quick recap on what we’ve covered: Thevalue indicates the lightness and darkness
00:41:56.450 of the color.
00:41:57.990 When a color appears lighter, it's closerto 'white,' giving it a higher value.
00:42:02.020 Now, check out these pictures – in the warmlight category.
00:42:06.820 Which one of the two lights shines brightand carries a high value?
00:42:10.740 You got it – it's the sunlight.
00:42:13.060 No surprises there; sunlight naturally outshinesthe earth's reflected light.
00:42:18.050 Now, onto the cool light category.
00:42:21.270 This one might need a bit of pondering.
00:42:23.809 Between the moon and the star, which one hasa high value?
00:42:27.650 It's a tricky one!
00:42:29.190 The star itself is really dazzling, but thesurrounding sky is pitch black.
00:42:34.280 On the other hand, the Moon spreads its glowall around, softer and wider.
00:42:40.250 Picture the Moon with that gentle, beautifulradiance, and the star throwing out a strong,
00:42:46.240 contrasting impression.
00:42:47.710 The star needs that pitch-dark night sky totruly stand out.
00:42:52.150 So the Moonlight carries a relatively highervalue.
00:42:55.800 Summing it up, Spring (Sun) brings warmthwith high value and chroma.
00:43:01.500 Autumn (Earth) is warm too, but with lowervalue and chroma.
00:43:06.510 Summer (Moon) cools things down with highvalue and lower chroma.
00:43:11.599 Lastly, Winter (Star) keeps it cool, but witha low value and high chroma.
00:43:17.990 Alright, let's take a deeper dive into theworld of seasonal colors and explore the 12
00:43:24.319 types.
00:43:25.319 Ready?
00:43:26.319 Cool, let's talk about subtypes!
00:43:28.309 Ever wondered about those beauties who seemto sit right in the middle of all seasons?
00:43:32.800 Well, they're the True subtypes – 100% committedto a particular season and super tuned in
00:43:38.420 to any hue changes.
00:43:40.570 They're the ones who fully embrace the vibeof their chosen season.
00:43:44.510 Now, let's unravel the mystery behind thenames of the other subtypes.
00:43:49.570 Check this out – Winter and Spring bothhave the Clear subtype in common.
00:43:53.839 Ever wondered why there's a Clear Spring anda Clear Winter type?
00:43:57.619 Or why are there Light Springs and Light Summers,Deep Autumns and Deep Winters, Soft Autumns
00:44:02.750 and Soft Summers?
00:44:04.839 It all circles back to the color attributeswe explored earlier.
00:44:08.960 Remember how we said the Sun (Spring) is allabout high value and high chroma, while the
00:44:13.740 Star (Winter) is about low value and highchroma?
00:44:17.450 Well, guess what attribute they both share?
00:44:20.960 High chroma!
00:44:22.640 And remember what we said earlier about highchroma?
00:44:25.480 It means the color appears brighter and clearer.
00:44:28.260 So, it's no surprise that the Clear subtypesare a thing for these two seasons.
00:44:33.700 And that rule plays out across the other subtypestoo.Think about it like this: the Sun (Spring)
00:44:40.480 and the Moon (Summer) both share the high-valueattribute, explaining why the Light subtype
00:44:46.569 fits up to these two.
00:44:48.190 Meanwhile, the Moon (Summer) and the Earth(Autumn) share low chroma, and this explains
00:44:54.880 why the Soft subtype belongs here!
00:44:57.500 The Earth (Autumn) and Star (Winter) sharelow value, and therefore the Deep subtype
00:45:02.920 fits in these two seasons.
00:45:04.700 And…
00:45:05.700 There you have it – the 12 Seasonal ColorTypes unfold based on the logic of hue, value,
00:45:11.349 and chroma.
00:45:12.609 Each subtype has its place, and it's not justrandom – it's all tied back to the unique
00:45:17.530 qualities of the seasons.
00:45:19.740 True Spring, True Summer, True Autumn andTrue Winter are the primitive seasonal color
00:45:25.790 subtypes corresponding to the four major seasons.
00:45:28.839 The other eight seasonal color subtypes areinfluenced by the two neighboring seasonal
00:45:33.420 color subtypes, carrying the characteristicsof both primitive seasonal color types.
00:45:38.960 Take Clear Spring as an example.
