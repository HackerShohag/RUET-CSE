# CSE 2206 Microprocessors, Microcontrollers and Assembly Language Sessional
CSE 2206 (Microprocessors, Microcontrollers and Assembly Language Sessional) Course from Second Year Even Semester taken by [Sadia Zaman Mishu](https://www.cse.ruet.ac.bd/Sadia_cse).

The directory contains assembly languages for a intel 8086 microprocessor but due to lacking of physical chipset it links the binary using gcc to a normal executable binary, so that it can be run using bash.
