\begin{abstract}
    This article presents a comparative analysis between the selection sort and merge sort algorithms. The efficiency and performance of these algorithms are evaluated based on their time complexity and space complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in various scenarios.
