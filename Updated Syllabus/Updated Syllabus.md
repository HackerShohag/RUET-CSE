Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology** 


**20. Grading/Evaluation** 

1. Grading Scale and Grades 

The letter grade system shall be used to access the performance of the student and shall be as follows: 



|**Range of Marks** |**Letter Grade** |**Grade Point** |
| - | - | - |
|80 % or above |A+ (A Plus) |4\.00 |
|75% to less than 80 % |A (A Regular) |3\.75 |
|70 % to less than 75% |A- (A Minus) |3\.50 |
|65% to less than 70% |B+ (B Plus) |3\.25 |
|60% to less than 65% |B (B Regular) |3\.00 |
|55% to less than 60% |B- (B Minus) |2\.75 |
|50% to less than 55% |C+ (C Plus) |2\.50 |
|45% to less than 50% |C (C Regular) |2\.25 |
|40% to less than 45% |D |2\.00 |
|Less than 40% |F |0\.00 |
|Incomplete |I |- |

2. Absence during Semester 

A student should not be absent from quizzes, tests etc. during the semester. Such absence will naturally lead to reduction in points/marks, which count towards the final grade. Absence in semester final examination due to lack of attendance (less than 50%) only of any courses will be considered as unregistered, hence requires a new registration with a regular semester.  

A student who has been absent for short period, up to a maximum of three weeks due to illness, should approach the course teacher(s) or the course coordinator(s) for a make‐up quizzes or assignments immediately on returning to the classes. Such request should be supported by medical certificate from University medical officer. The medical certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner (with the registration number shown explicitly or the certificates) will also be acceptable only in those cases where the student has valid reason for his/her absence from the University. 

3. Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) 

Grade point average (GPA) is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses passed/completed by a student in a semester. ‘F’ grades do not count for GPA calculation. GPA of a semester will be calculated as follows: 

- =1

CGPA =

- =1

Where, n is the total number of courses passed by the student,  is the number of credits allotted to a particular course  and  is the grade point corresponding to the grade awarded for i-th course. 

The overall or Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) gives the cumulative performance of the student from first semester up to any other semester which it refers and is computed by dividing the total grade points (∑ ) accumulated up to the date by the total credit hours (∑ ). Both GPA and CGPA are rounded off to the second place of decimal for reporting.  

4. Withdrawal from a Semester 

If a student is unable to complete the semester Final Examination due to illness, accident or any other valid reason etc., he/she may apply to the Head of the department. Each Department will decide for total withdrawal from the semester before the start of the semester final examination. He/she may choose not to withdraw any laboratory/sessional/design course if the grade obtained in such a course is ‘D’ or better. The application must be supported by a medical certificate from any authorized Medical Officer. The Academic Council will take the final decision about such applications. However, he/she will not be permitted to the next year class unless he/she completes the required credit for that year. 

5. Incomplete (I) courses 

A grade ‘I’ shall be awarded for the courses (like project & thesis, design etc.) in the 1st  semester, which continue through to the even semester. 

6. Retake 
1. Backlog Examination
1) There  will  be  Backlog  Examination  after  the  publication  of  result  of  2nd  semester examination.  
1) ‘F’ grade(s) obtained after semester examination will be considered as backlog course(s).  
1) Students are allowed to sit for maximum 3 backlog courses in 1st and/or 2nd semester(s).  
1) Class test marks of Backlog courses in  1st/2nd semester(s) will be counted for Backlog examination.  
1) Maximum B (B regular) grade will be counted in Backlog examination.  

Backlog  Courses:  The  course(s)  which  a  student  registered  in  a  Semester  but  after  Semester examination he/she obtained ‘F’ grade in that course(s).  

2. Short Semester Examination 

The Short Semester Examination on only backlog courses may be conducted for the students who have participated in their 4(four)/5(Five) year degree course (up to 4th /5th year backlog examination). A student can register maximum 5 (Five) incomplete courses including sessional, project and thesis to obtain Bachelor degree. The short semester examination will be arranged in a convenient time by the Head of the Department within 10 weeks of the publication of results of the final year backlog examination. The evaluation system will be the similar as regular semester. The students willing to appear at the short semester examination have to apply to the Head of the Department and with his permission  must register within 15 (Fifteen) working days of publication of final  year Backlog examination results. Maximum grade B will be counted in short semester examination.             

7. Grade Improvement 

The courses in which a student has obtained ‘D’ or a higher Grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. Any course in which a student has obtained ‘F’ grade will not be counted towards his/her earned credits.  

A student, who obtains an ‘F’ grade in any Core Course in any semester, he/she will have to repeat the course. If a student obtains an ‘F’ in an Optional Course, he/she may choose to repeat the course or take a substitute course if available.  

‘F’ grades will be considered as backlog courses. ‘F’ grades will not be counted for GPA calculation but will stay permanently on the Grade Sheet and Transcript.  

A student obtaining D grade in a course will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if CGPA of the student falls below 2.20. In such case he/she will be awarded the new grade thus he/she obtains or retains his/her previous grade if he/she fails. 

8. Dropout 
1. The names of the students shall be struck off and removed from the rolls on the following grounds:  
   1) Non-payment of University fees and dues within the prescribed period.  
   1) Forced to discontinue his/her studies under disciplinary rules.  
   1) Withdrawal of names from the rolls of the University on grounds acceptable to the Vice- Chancellor of the University/ nominated authority after having cleared all dues. 
   1) Could not earn required credits for graduation as outlined in the respective curriculum and/or fulfill CGPA requirement within the maximum allowed time of 7 academic years. For Architecture maximum allowed time is 8 academic years. 
1. Every student whose name has been struck off the rolls by exercise of the clauses (ii) of Article 1 seeking re-admission after expiry of the period for which he/she was forced to discontinue his/her studies, shall submit an application to the Head of the Department in the prescribed form before the commencement of the session to which he/she seeks re-admission. The Head of the Department shall forward the application to the Registrar of the University with his remarks. In case the readmission is allowed, the student will be required on payment of all dues to get him/her-self admitted no later than one week from the date of permission given by the Registrar. All readmission should preferably be completed before the session starts. The percentage of attendance of the re- admitted students shall be counted from the date of recommendation of the concerned Head of the department. 
1. No  student  who  has  withdrawn  his/her  name  under  clause  (iii)  of  Article  1  shall  be  given readmission. 
1. In case, a student whose name has been struck off the rolls under clause (i) of Article 1 seeks readmission within the session in which his/her name was struck off, he/she shall be readmitted on payment of all the arrears fees and dues. But if he/she seeks readmission in any subsequent session, the procedure for his/her readmission will be the same as described under Article 2. 
1. The application of a student  for readmission will be considered if he/she applies within two academic sessions from the semester of discontinuance of his/her studies in the University. Other than debarment as punishment under the ordinance related to discipline, a student failing for any other reason whatsoever to become a candidate for a semester final examination in which he/she ought to have had in the usual process of his/her progressive academic activities, shall be considered to have discontinued his/her studies for the relevant semester together with striking the name off from current roll and two such discontinuance periods will be considered equivalent to that for one academic session. The maximum period of discontinuance under no circumstances is to exceed two academic sessions during a student’s period of studies for the degree. 
1. In case any application for readmission is rejected, the student may appeal to the Academic Council and, in this case, the decision of the Academic Council shall be final. 
1. A student, whose name has been struck off the rolls by exercise of clause (iv) of Article 1, is not eligible to seek readmission.
